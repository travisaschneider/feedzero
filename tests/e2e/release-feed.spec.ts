/**
 * E2E test for the first-launch auto-subscribe flow.
 *
 * When a returning user has zero feeds (fresh DB), the app automatically
 * subscribes them to the FeedZero release notes feed at CHANGELOG_FEED_URL.
 * This test verifies the full integration: app init → auto-subscribe fires →
 * proxy fetch intercepted → feed parsed → sidebar shows the release feed.
 *
 * The /api/feed proxy is mocked with the vendored fixture BEFORE navigation
 * so the auto-subscribe request is caught. Without that ordering, the request
 * races past the mock and silently fails (try/catch swallows it), giving a
 * false-green test that doesn't actually exercise the flow.
