# Contributing to FeedZero

## Development Workflow

This project follows **Red-Green-Refactor (RGR)** for all code changes:

1. **RED** - Write a failing test first
2. **GREEN** - Write minimal code to make it pass
3. **REFACTOR** - Clean up the code (this step is mandatory)

No production code without a failing test. No commit without refactoring.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/feedzero.git
cd feedzero
npm install
npm run dev     # Dev server at http://localhost:3000
npm test        # Run tests
```

## Running Tests

```bash
npm test              # All unit/integration tests
npm run test:watch    # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Coverage report (90% threshold enforced)
npm run test:e2e      # Playwright E2E tests
npx tsc --noEmit      # Type check
```

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode (no `any` except in type declarations for untyped libraries)
- No ESLint/Prettier - TypeScript compiler is the primary static analysis tool
- Self-documenting code: if you need a comment to explain *what*, rename or extract instead
- Comments only for *why* (intent, trade-offs, non-obvious decisions)

## Architecture Guidelines

### Core Modules Are Framework-Agnostic

Code in `src/core/` and `src/utils/` must have zero React imports. These modules are the shared backend that could be reused in other contexts (CLI, mobile app, etc.).

### Result Types Over Exceptions

All core functions return `Result<T>` types instead of throwing:

```typescript
const result = await addFeed(url);
if (!result.ok) {
  // Handle error via result.error
  return;
}
// Use result.value
```

### State Lives in Zustand Stores

UI components subscribe to store slices. Stores call core modules directly. URL is the source of truth for navigation.

### Security First

- Sanitize all external content through DOMPurify
- Use Web Crypto API for encryption (never hand-roll crypto)
- Validate and block private IPs in proxy endpoints
- Never trust user or feed input

## Pull Request Process

1. **Branch from `main`**: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`

2. **Follow RGR**: Tests first, then implementation, then refactor

3. **Verify before pushing**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   npx tsc --noEmit
   npm run test:e2e  # If touching UI
   ```

4. **Write descriptive commits**:
   - Use conventional prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`
   - For bug fixes, include: What (symptom), Why (root cause), Fix (what changed), Prevention (tests added)

5. **Keep PRs focused**: One feature or fix per PR. Split large changes.

6. **Update documentation**: If you changed behavior, update `docs/` to match.

## What We're Looking For

- Bug fixes with regression tests
- Performance improvements with benchmarks
- Accessibility improvements
- Feed format compatibility (RSS variants, Atom edge cases)
- Privacy enhancements that don't compromise usability

## What We're Not Looking For

- Features that require server-side state (beyond encrypted blob storage)
- Analytics, telemetry, or tracking of any kind
- Dependencies that make network calls without user action
- UI redesigns without prior discussion
